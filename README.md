# SmartExpense API üí∏

**SmartExpense** is a secure, robust, and intelligent REST API for personal expense tracking. Built with Spring Boot, it allows users to manage their finances, set budgets, and gain insights into their spending habits.

This is a backend-only, portfolio project demonstrating a modern Java tech stack, secure API practices, and advanced business logic.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Secure Authentication:** Full user registration and login system using **Spring Security** and **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
* **Secure Endpoints:** All endpoints are protected. Users can only create, read, update, or delete their *own* expenses and categories.
* **Data Aggregation:** A `GET /api/summary/monthly` endpoint that performs server-side calculations to return a full monthly report (total spending, top category, and a complete category breakdown).
* **Real-time Budget Alerts:** Users can set a monthly budget. When adding a new expense, the API checks the total spending in real-time and returns a `budgetWarning` if the user has exceeded their limit.
* **Advanced Filtering:** The `GET /api/expenses` endpoint can be dynamically filtered by date range or by category.
* **Custom Exception Handling:** A professional, global exception handler (`@RestControllerAdvice`) provides clean, safe, and consistent JSON error messages for all API errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request).
